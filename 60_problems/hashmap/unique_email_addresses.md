The structure set, which provides in/contains operation in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) time in average case.

In the case of HashMap, it replaces the old value with the new one.

***Using Hash Set to reduce to O(C) c is the total content of emails***
***Using 2 loop will be O(n) n is nums of emails***
***space complexity will be O(C) as well because of adding to set
