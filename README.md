# Data Structure Reviews
## Hash Table 
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/hash_data_structure.htm

data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value
it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data
Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.

## Linked List

### Why Linked List?
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

### Advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion
